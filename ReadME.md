## Introduction

This project is an implementation of Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing. Brief explanation of the concepts Sentiment Analysis and Natural Language Processing can be found in the Report. This code can be used by any organization as a backend code which needs to perform Sentiment Analysis for business purposes. The dataset I used in this code is "Amazon Fine Food Reviews", but Sentiment Analysis can be run on any dataset like Twitter data, Social media comments, Movie Reviews, etc. These datasets are available on Kaggle.com. 



## Manifest

```
- Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb --> Python file in which the project code is implemented.
- Reviews.CSV --> File containing the Dataset. 

```

## Prerequisites

You need to have basic Python knowlegde to understand the code in this project. Also, basic Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing knowledge is required to understand how this project works.

I have implemented this code using Google Colab, so there are no prerequistes as such, but if you want to run this code on your local system, you need to have the following items installed on your PC. 

- Python
- NLTK Library
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- NumPY
- MatplotLIB

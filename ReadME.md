## Introduction

This project is an implementation of Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing. Brief explanation of the concepts Sentiment Analysis and Natural Language Processing can be found in the Report. This code can be used by any organization as a backend code which needs to perform Sentiment Analysis for business purposes. The dataset I used in this code is "Amazon Fine Food Reviews", but Sentiment Analysis can be run on any dataset like Twitter data, Social media comments, Movie Reviews, etc. These datasets are available on Kaggle.com. 



## Manifest

```
- Sentiment_Analysis.ipynb --> Python file in which the project code is implemented.
- Reviews.CSV --> File containing the Dataset. 

```

## Prerequisites

You need to have basic Python knowlegde to understand the code in this project. Also, basic Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing knowledge is required to understand how this project works.

I have implemented this code using Google Colab, so there are no prerequistes as such, but if you want to run this code on your local system, you need to have the following items installed on your PC. 

- Python
- NLTK Library
- Keras
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- NumPY
- MatplotLIB

## Snapshots



## Installation 

- Describe how your software / development is installed. Sometimes it's easy as something like:

```bash
sudo apt-get install my-cool-thing
```

- often it involves a bit of  downloading sources and building:

```bash
git clone my-cool-repo.git
cd /my-cool-repo
cd /build
make
```

- You should list out steps as unambiguously as humanly possible!!
- Often people don't read the actual install instructions, but they just copy and paste what is in the black boxes. __Keep this in mind!__

## Usage

- Describe how the program / project is going to be used once it is installed. 
- If it is a command line app, you'll want to give CLI examples:

```bash
cool-project -arg1 -arg2
```

- then maybe show a screenshot of  the results :smile:

## Support

- tell users how they can get a hold of you

Contact: [email me](trevor.tomesh@gmail.com)

## Road-map

- List your panned future developments
- This is a good way to keep track of what it is that you want to do in the future!


## License

- Depending on what kind of project you are doing, you might have a specific copyright. 
- Usually on github, everything is open source!
- You can find license info here: [license](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-on-github/licensing-a-repository)

## Project Status

- A lot of the time people will abandon projects. You should always at least let people know if you aren't interested in working on a project anymore!
- Someone might want to pick it up on your behalf!
